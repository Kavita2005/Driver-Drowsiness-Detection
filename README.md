# Driver Drowsiness Detection System  

## Description  
The Driver Drowsiness Detection System is a computer vision-based application designed to enhance road safety by monitoring a driver’s eyes and detecting signs of fatigue. If drowsiness is detected, the system triggers an alert to prevent accidents.  

This project is especially useful for long-distance drivers, transport companies, and vehicle safety systems.
